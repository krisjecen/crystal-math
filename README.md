Crystal Math is a one-person math puzzle game where you click or tap the randomly-valued crystals to try to match your score to the target number.

Crystal Math functions a bit like blackjack: there's a good bit of randomness :game_die:, you can't always win:dizzy:, and if your score exceeds the target, you lose. :anger:
